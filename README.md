# HW1_Refactor_Semantic
Refactor existing code and organize it using semantic structure in HTML an CSS


Overview:
For this assessment, we focused on modifying the elements’ structure to more sematic and easier to follow. We worked on changing the some of the tags that were given and rename most of the classes for better connection between the HTML and CSS file and minimize repeated codes on both files. All the changes we made didn’t affect the overall outlook of the website or the functionalities. 


Key Topics:
Here are the some of the key topics we used throughout this assessment.

-   Semantic elements such as section, article, nav, header and footer
-   Attributes in HTML
-   Links, images, classes, Ids 
-   Color, positioning, font size and family

We also added comments in the HTML file to know what each section is for without having to go though the dev tool. Comments and descriptions were added to the CSS file for better navigation and understanding to make the code look cleaner and more organized.
